// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items::
let countries = ["Makkah", "Switerland", "Norway", "Turkey", "Italy"];
// for list of countries ,we use forEach method::
countries.forEach(countrylist => {
    console.log(countrylist);
});
